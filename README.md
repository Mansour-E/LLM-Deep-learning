Machine Learning & LLM Deep Dive



A comprehensive repository dedicated to the implementation of Machine Learning, Deep Learning architectures, and Large Language Models (LLMs). This project covers the full pipeline from foundational neural networks to advanced Transformer-based models.
Note: All implementations, optimizations, and problem-solving approaches are developed by me to master the mechanics of modern AI from scratch to deployment.
🚀 Project Overview
The objective of this repository is to demonstrate a deep understanding of AI model internals. Instead of just using high-level libraries as "black boxes," these projects focus on building architectures from the ground up to understand the underlying mathematics and optimization strategies.
